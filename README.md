# SigenStorPuck

A round touchscreen status display for a Sigenergy SigenStor solar and battery system.

It runs on a Waveshare **ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.75** — a 466×466 round AMOLED with
capacitive touch — and shows live power flow, battery state, solar generation against
forecast, consumption, where the day's energy went, and what it all cost.

## Three ways to get data — read this first

The Puck can take its readings from one of three places, and it matters which, because
some screens and features need one of them.

**Modbus TCP — talking straight to your plant.** No other software involved. The Puck
reads your inverter or gateway directly over your own network. This remains the default
for a new installation.

**SigenStorDisplay Server.** A separate companion application that manages and logs a
Sigenergy plant, which the Puck can then read from. It unlocks the Flows and Cost
screens, stepping back through past days, and complete daily charts.
**SigenStorDisplay has not been released yet.** The Puck already has full support for it
built in and ready for when it is, but until then those parts are unavailable.

**Home Assistant.** The Puck reads mapped entities through Home Assistant's REST API.
This is useful when Home Assistant is already the single collector for the inverter,
battery and meters: the Puck consumes that normalized home-energy environment without
becoming another direct Modbus client. The mappings are semantic and fully editable, so
this works with different inverter and battery integrations, not only Sigenergy. No
entity IDs are assumed.

### What works with which

| | Modbus | SigenStorDisplay Server | Home Assistant |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| **Power** screen | ● | ● | ● |
| **Battery** screen | ● | ● | ● |
| **Solar** screen | ● | ● | ◐ by default; ● with forecast configured |
| **Load** screen | ◐ headline and live draw only | ● | ◐ headline and live draw only |
| **Flows** screen | — | ● | — |
| **Cost** screen | — | ● | — |
| **Settings** screen | ● | ● | ● |
| Solar forecast | ● calculated on the Puck | ● from the server | ● disabled, Puck, or HA entities |
| Today's charts | ◐ from when the Puck was switched on | ● the whole day, and after a restart | ◐ restored from HA Recorder when available; otherwise from boot |
| Step back through past days | — | ● up to 7 days | — |
| Tariff rates and savings | — | ● | — |

● full · ◐ partial · — not available

On Modbus and Home Assistant the Flows and Cost screens are removed altogether rather
than left showing dashes, so you get five screens instead of seven.

## The screens

**Swipe left and right across the glass to move between screens.** The row of dots along
the bottom shows how many there are and which one you are on. If the Puck is out of
reach, holding the **BOOT** button for 2 seconds moves to the next screen too, and the
auto-cycle can step through them on its own — see **Auto-cycle every** under Settings.

Which screens appear at all is up to you — see **Screens** under Settings.

Behind the solar, load and battery screens is that day's own curve, drawn faintly so it
does not compete with the figures. In Home Assistant mode the Puck starts one optional,
entity-filtered Recorder backfill after its first successful live poll. It restores today's
available PV, battery and load curves in bounded two-hour windows, with a normal live poll
between windows. If Recorder is disabled, unavailable, excludes an entity or has no
history, the live readings continue normally and the affected curves simply fill from
boot. Modbus curves always fill from boot. With a
**SigenStorDisplay Server** the whole day is fetched, so the curve is complete straight
away.

### The two buttons

| | Press | Hold 2 seconds | Hold 5 seconds |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PWR** | Back one day | Auto-cycle on/off | Power off |
| **BOOT** | Forward one day | Next screen | Restart |

The day buttons are **SigenStorDisplay Server Only** — on Modbus and Home Assistant there
is no stored history to step back into, and the buttons say `LIVE ONLY` instead. With a server you can
step back seven days; the Power screen always stays live, and the day you are looking at
is named just above the page dots. Left alone for two minutes, it goes back to today
by itself.

If the screen is off on a schedule, the first press of any button just wakes it up.

## Installing

### 1. Flash the firmware

Plug the Puck into a computer with a USB-C cable and open this page in **Chrome or Edge**:

### → [Install SigenStorPuck](https://markab.github.io/SigenStorPuck/)

It flashes over WebSerial — nothing to download and no drivers to install. Safari and
Firefox cannot do this, and neither can anything on an iPhone or iPad.

After the first flash the Puck updates itself — see **Firmware** below.

### 2. Join it to your WiFi

On first boot the Puck puts up its own WiFi network and shows you the name. Yours will
end in six different characters — it is that device's own name, so two Pucks side by side
do not clash.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/img/setup-wifi.png" width="240" alt="The WiFi setup screen, showing the network name to join"></p>

1. On your phone or laptop, join that WiFi network. A setup page opens by itself; if it
   does not, browse to `http://192.168.4.1/`.
2. Tap **Configure WiFi**, pick your home network and enter its password.
3. If this is your second Puck, give it a **device name** on the same page so the two do
   not clash.
4. Save. The Puck joins your network and the screen changes to **Not configured**.

### 3. Open the settings page

The **Not configured** screen shows a QR code and the Puck's own address, given two ways:
the friendly name and the IP. Both appear because not every phone can resolve `.local`
names — if the first does nothing, use the second.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/img/setup-configure.png" width="240" alt="The Not configured screen, showing a QR code above both addresses"></p>

**Scan the QR code with your phone**, or type either address into any browser on the same
network. The code carries the IP, being the one that always works.

```
http://sigenstorpuck.local/
```

### 4. Choose and configure a data source

#### Direct Modbus

1. Check **Data source** is set to **Plant over Modbus**. It is out of the box.
2. Under **Plant (Modbus)**, enter the IP address of your inverter or gateway. Leave the
   port at `502` and the plant address at `247` unless you know otherwise.
3. Optionally add your inverter as a device — this is what gives you battery temperature
   and the daily totals — and a charger if you have one, for EV power.
4. Save, then **Restart Device** from the Danger section.

Two things to do outside the Puck, or it will not be able to connect:

- In the **Sigen app**, allow Modbus TCP access for the Puck's IP address. Access is
  granted per address, and a device that has not been added simply gets no reply.
- In your **router**, give the Puck a fixed (reserved) IP address, so the permission you
  just granted does not stop working the next time addresses are handed out.

Data should appear within a few seconds of the restart.

#### SigenStorDisplay Server

Once it is available, set **Data source** to *SigenStor Display server*, then paste the
enrolment URL from the server's **Admin → Kiosk devices** page into the **Server** section
and save. The URL carries the server address and access token together.

#### Home Assistant

Prerequisites are a reachable Home Assistant instance, energy entities from any
integration, and a long-lived access token. In Home Assistant, create a dedicated local
non-administrator user for the Puck; sign in as that user, open the user profile, and
create a [**Long-lived access token**](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_api/#long-lived-access-token).
Avoid using an administrator's everyday token. Revoking this token later immediately
removes the Puck's access.

1. Set **Data source** to **Home Assistant**.
2. Under **Home Assistant**, enter the base URL the Puck can reach, including the scheme
   and port where needed, such as `http://homeassistant.local:8123`.
3. Paste the long-lived access token. It is stored in the Puck's NVS, never compiled into
   firmware, and the settings page will only show a masked suffix after saving.
4. Map the entity IDs your installation provides. Grey Sigenergy entity IDs shown in the
   fields are example placeholders only: they are not configured or saved unless typed,
   and other Home Assistant integrations should use their own entity IDs.
5. Optionally, choose whether solar forecasting is disabled, calculated on the Puck, or
   read from semantic Home Assistant entities. The default is disabled, preserving
   existing HA behaviour.
6. Save, use **Test Home Assistant connection**, then restart the Puck.

The Puck sends one [`POST /api/template`](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/rest/#post-apitemplate)
per live poll. Home Assistant renders only the
configured entities and their units into a compact response; the Puck does not fetch
entities one at a time or download all HA states. In this mode the Puck never opens a
Modbus connection.

After the first successful live poll following a boot, the Puck also reads filtered Home
Assistant Recorder history for the mapped entities needed by today's Solar, Battery and
Load curves. Consecutive two-hour requests keep each response bounded, and only one window
runs between live polls. Recorder is optional: an empty, excluded or unavailable entity
leaves a gap, and a failed window never invalidates live data or discards completed
windows. Transient failures are retried twice for the current window; malformed responses
stop the backfill. No previous day is downloaded or made browseable.

## Settings

Everything below is on the Puck's own settings page at `http://sigenstorpuck.local/`.
Most changes take effect straight away; the ones needing a restart are marked ↻.

### Network

<table>
<tr><th width="32%">Option</th><th>What it does</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Device name</strong> ↻</td><td>What the Puck calls itself on your network. The default is <code>sigenstorpuck</code>, reachable at <code>http://sigenstorpuck.local/</code>. Change it if you have more than one Puck.</td></tr>
</table>

### Data source

<table>
<tr><th width="32%">Option</th><th>What it does</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Plant over Modbus (LAN only)</strong> ↻</td><td><strong>The default.</strong> Read your inverter or gateway directly. Removes the Flows and Cost screens, which need data only a server has.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>SigenStor Display server</strong> ↻</td><td>Read from a <strong>SigenStorDisplay Server</strong>. Not yet available.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Home Assistant</strong> ↻</td><td>Read generic, explicitly mapped energy entities through Home Assistant's REST API. The Puck does not contact the plant over Modbus in this mode.</td></tr>
</table>

### Plant (Modbus)

*Used on the Modbus source.*

<table>
<tr><th width="32%">Option</th><th>What it does</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Gateway or inverter IP</strong></td><td>The address on your network of the device that speaks Modbus TCP.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Port</strong></td><td><code>502</code> unless you have changed it on the plant.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Plant address</strong></td><td><code>247</code> unless you have changed it.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Slave ID</strong></td><td>The address of one device inside the plant, as shown in the Sigen app. <code>0</code> means the slot is unused. Four slots are available; all are optional.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Type</strong></td><td><em>Inverter</em> or <em>Charger</em>. Adding an inverter gives you battery temperature and the daily totals; adding a charger gives you EV power.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>DC charger</strong></td><td>Tick if that inverter has a vehicle charger built into it, so its DC output counts as EV power.</td></tr>
</table>

### Server

**SigenStorDisplay Server Only** — nothing here affects the Home Assistant or Modbus source.

<table>
<tr><th width="32%">Option</th><th>What it does</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Enrolment URL</strong></td><td>Paste the whole URL from the server's Admin → Kiosk devices page. It fills in the server address and access token together. The page shows the last four characters of the stored token so you can tell one device's enrolment from another's.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Test server connection</strong></td><td>Fetches data once and reports exactly what happened — the quickest way to find a wrong address or a revoked token.</td></tr>
</table>

### Home Assistant

The URL, token, and at least one mapping are required to start polling. No single entity
mapping is universal across HA integrations, so mappings are individually optional; for
a useful power diagram, configure PV, grid, and battery power, plus home/load power if HA
provides it. SOC and today's totals enable their corresponding figures.

| Mapping | Canonical meaning and sign |
|---|---|
| PV power | Solar generation, positive, in W or kW |
| Grid power | Positive importing, negative exporting, in W or kW |
| Battery power | Positive charging, negative discharging, in W or kW |
| Home/load power | Positive consumption, in W or kW; preferred over derivation |
| EV power | Positive charging draw, in W or kW |
| Plant/system power | Integration's total active plant power, in W or kW |
| Off-grid state | `on`/`true`/`1`/`off_grid`, or the corresponding false value |
| Battery SOC / SOH | Percentage with HA unit `%` |
| Battery capacity | Wh or kWh |
| Battery temperature | °C (`°C`, `C`, or `degC`) |
| Today's six energy totals | PV generation, load, import, export, battery charge and discharge, each in Wh or kWh |
| Solar forecast | Today's total and remaining energy in Wh or kWh, actual-vs-forecast in `%`, and peak power in W or kW |

Every mapping can be overridden or cleared individually. If home/load power is not
mapped, the Puck derives it only when PV, grid, battery, and EV are all known:
`home = max(0, PV - battery + grid - EV)`. Leaving the optional EV mapping blank
explicitly means there is no separate EV leg and uses zero in that equation. Mapping an
EV entity whose current state is unavailable does **not** turn it into zero and prevents
the derivation until it recovers.

HA values keep the `Snapshot` units used by every existing screen: kW, kWh, %, and °C.
`W` is converted to `kW`, and `Wh` to `kWh`. Missing units, unsupported units, `unknown`,
`unavailable`, and non-numeric states remain unknown rather than becoming zero. Correct
the HA entity/template sensor so its `unit_of_measurement` is one of the supported units.

HTTP is supported for a trusted LAN. HTTPS uses the firmware's trusted CA bundle and
validates the certificate; there is no insecure TLS mode. Use a hostname whose
certificate chains to a CA trusted by the device.

### Solar forecast

Direct Modbus always calculates the forecast on the Puck. With a
**SigenStorDisplay Server** it comes from the server. Home Assistant users explicitly
choose **Disabled**, **Calculate on Puck**, or **Home Assistant entities**; missing settings
from an older installation default safely to Disabled.

For **Calculate on Puck**, the location and roof fields below use the existing cached
Open-Meteo model without changing HA live acquisition or contacting Modbus. For
**Home Assistant entities**, the semantic mappings may point to any suitable HA
integration. Today's total forecast is required to make the Solar screen meaningful;
remaining energy, actual-vs-forecast percentage, and peak power are optional. They are
included in the same compact HA template request as live data and any that isn't
mapped is left off the Solar screen from the next restart.

<table>
<tr><th width="32%">Option</th><th>What it does</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Latitude / Longitude</strong></td><td>Where your panels are. <strong>Leave both blank for no forecast</strong> — the Solar screen then hides its ring rather than showing an empty one. Setting a location also tells the Puck your timezone, which is what lines the daily charts up with your own midnight.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>System loss</strong></td><td>Everything between the panels' rating and your meter: inverter efficiency, wiring, dirt on the glass. <code>0.85</code> is a sensible starting point.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Inverter cap</strong></td><td>The most your inverter can put out, in kW. <code>0</code> means no limit.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Size (kWp)</strong></td><td>An array's rating. <code>0</code> leaves that slot unused. Up to four arrays.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Tilt</strong></td><td>The angle from flat. <code>0</code> is horizontal, <code>35</code> is a typical pitched roof, <code>90</code> is vertical.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Azimuth</strong></td><td>A compass bearing: <code>180</code> due south, <code>90</code> east, <code>270</code> west, <code>0</code> north.</td></tr>
</table>

### Display

*All of these work on all three sources.*

<table>
<tr><th width="32%">Option</th><th>What it does</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Brightness</strong></td><td>Normal running brightness, 0 to 255.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Poll interval</strong></td><td>How often to fetch new readings, in seconds. <code>5</code> is the default.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Dim after</strong></td><td>Seconds of no touching before the screen dims. <code>0</code> never dims.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Dimmed brightness</strong></td><td>How dim it goes. It dims rather than blanking, so it stays readable from across the room.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Screen off from / until</strong></td><td>Hours to switch the screen off completely, for overnight. <strong>Off means off, not dimmed.</strong> Any button brings it back for 30 seconds. Blank both boxes to leave the screen on all the time. The times are the Puck's own local time, which the page shows next to the boxes so you can check it is right.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Orientation</strong> ↻</td><td>Quarter turns, <code>0</code> to <code>3</code>, for mounting the Puck whichever way round suits.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Auto-cycle every</strong></td><td>Seconds between automatically moving to the next screen. <code>0</code> turns it off. Also switchable by holding PWR for 2 seconds.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Sweep every</strong></td><td>Minutes between a brightness band sweeping across the screen. This evens out wear on the panel, which matters on an AMOLED showing much the same picture all day. <code>0</code> turns it off.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Screens</strong> ↻</td><td>A tick per screen for whether it appears at all, and a second for whether the auto-cycle stops on it. Power and Settings are always shown, so their boxes are fixed. On Modbus and Home Assistant, Flows and Cost are struck through and cannot be ticked.</td></tr>
</table>

### Firmware

<table>
<tr><th width="32%">Option</th><th>What it does</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Install</strong></td><td>Downloads the newer release and applies it. The Puck restarts on its own. Only appears when there is one.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Check now</strong></td><td>Looks for a newer release straight away.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Check for a newer release when this page is opened</strong></td><td>Off by default, so the Puck contacts nothing but your own network unless you ask it to. Tick it to be told about new releases when you open this page. Installing one is always a separate click.</td></tr>
</table>

### Danger

<table>
<tr><th width="32%">Option</th><th>What it does</th></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Restart Device</strong></td><td>Reboots it. Needed after any ↻ change above.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Forget server and token</strong></td><td>Clears your server details. You will need the enrolment URL again.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Forget Home Assistant token</strong></td><td>Clears only the HA credential; the URL and semantic mappings remain so a replacement token can be entered without rebuilding the configuration.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Forget WiFi and restart</strong></td><td>Clears the WiFi password and brings the setup network back, for moving the Puck to a different network.</td></tr>
</table>

## Troubleshooting

| On screen | What it means |
|---|---|
| **WiFi setup** | Not on your network yet. Join the setup network shown and follow step 2. |
| **Connecting to WiFi** | Joining your network. It should pass in a few seconds. |
| **Not configured** | On WiFi, but it does not know where to get data. Follow steps 3 and 4. |
| **Waiting for data** | Configured, but nothing has arrived yet. Normal just after a restart. |
| **Waiting for clock** | It needs the time from the internet before it can make a secure connection. Passes on its own once your network lets it reach an NTP server. |
| **No data** | The active source failed and the reason appears underneath. Check its URL/address and connection test; for Modbus, also check the Puck is still allowed in the Sigen app. |
| **Re-enrol needed** | *Server only.* The access token has been revoked. Create a new kiosk device and paste the fresh enrolment URL. |
| **HA token rejected** | Home Assistant returned 401/403. Replace the long-lived token and check that it belongs to an active user. |
| **entities unavailable** | HA answered, but every mapped entity is `unknown`, `unavailable`, non-numeric, or has an unsupported/missing unit. Use the connection test for detail and inspect those entities in HA Developer Tools. |
| `LIVE ONLY` | You pressed a day button on Modbus or Home Assistant, neither of which has historical backfill in this version. |

If a Modbus setup worked and then stopped, the usual cause is the Puck's IP address
changing, which quietly invalidates the permission granted in the Sigen app. Reserve the
address in your router and grant it again.

## The stand

A desk stand for the Puck. It seats into the round face at the front and sits on the
moulded base. Three parts in the file: the stand itself and two small caps at the top
edge, either side of centre.

## Building it yourself

```bash
pio run -e puck -t upload -t monitor
```

Screens are developed against canned payloads on the desktop rather than by reflashing,
which is where every screenshot above came from:

```bash
pio run -e sim && .pio/build/sim/program
```

`n`/`p` change fixture, `[`/`]` change screen, `d` shows the parsed data behind what you
are looking at. `--modbus` previews the shorter five-screen arrangement also used by HA.

`--selftest` runs the checks that need no hardware: Home Assistant template/payload,
Recorder parsing and unit handling, source compatibility, the Modbus register decoder,
history ring, button gestures, solar forecast model and screen-off window.

## Home Assistant V1 scope

Home Assistant provides live power, battery values, configured today's totals and an
optional solar forecast from HA entities or the Puck's native model. A single optional
Recorder backfill can restore today's chart after restart using bounded two-hour requests;
without usable Recorder history, the same charts fill from live polls beginning at boot.
Previous-day browsing, past-day chart retrieval, detailed source-to-sink flows, tariffs and
costs/savings remain deliberately unimplemented. The day controls therefore remain
`LIVE ONLY` in HA mode.
