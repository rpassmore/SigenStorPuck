// The day at the grid: how much was imported and exported, drawn as a bipolar
// day chart with import above a zero line and export below it, plus the live AC
// figures — grid frequency and phase voltage.
//
// A day screen like battery, solar and load: the totals and the chart follow the
// day you step back to, while the live pill and the AC figures are hidden on a
// past day because they are right-now values the server cannot date.
//
// Frequency and voltage come from the inverter's running-info registers — read
// directly on the Modbus source, and via /api/summary from server 0.26.0. Where
// neither supplies them (Home Assistant, an older server) those two stats stay
// empty and the rest of the screen stands on its own. Built for both boards:
// src/ui/screen_grid.cpp is the round layout, src/ui_landscape/screen_grid.cpp
// the wide one.
