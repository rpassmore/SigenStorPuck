// Today's PV forecast, fetched straight from Open-Meteo (docs/PLAN.md §D4).
//
// Used by direct Modbus and optionally by Home Assistant. With a server in the
// path the forecast arrives already reduced in /api/summary's `solar` block,
// computed by the model that also feeds the dashboard — one house, one number.
//
// The fetch is deliberately small: one request an hour, ~2 KB, from the same
// free endpoint the server uses. Open-Meteo's `timeformat=unixtime` means no
// ISO-8601 parsing, and `timezone=auto` makes it answer with the offset for the
// coordinates — which is worth as much as the irradiance is, because the Puck
// itself runs on UTC (net.cpp sets no timezone) and plant_system_timezone
// reads 0 on this plant even in summer. That offset lets the native forecast
// path anchor the day charts to a real local midnight.
