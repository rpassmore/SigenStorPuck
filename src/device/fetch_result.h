// Why a poll failed, shared by both data sources (docs/PLAN.md §D1).
//
// One enum rather than one per source, so poller.cpp, the status line and the
// settings page keep working whichever source is configured. Values that can
// only arise on one path are marked as such; nothing has to handle the ones its
// own source cannot produce.
//
// The distinctions matter because they need different words on screen: a
// network fault will fix itself, a revoked token never will, and a certificate
// error caused by a wrong clock is not a certificate problem.
