// PV generation forecast from hourly irradiance (docs/PLAN.md §D4).
//
// A second implementation of a model the server already has, which is normally
// exactly what CLAUDE.md forbids — so the reason is worth stating. On the Modbus
// source there is no server to ask, and HA may also choose this local model. The
// forecast is the only thing screen 3 cannot otherwise fill from those sources.
//
// It is deliberately a *port* of app/solar.py rather than a fresh derivation:
// same solar-position formulae, same plane-of-array transposition, same slot
// integration, same 30-minute slots the server's summary block uses. Two figures
// for one house that disagree would be worse than one figure that is missing, so
// where the two differ it should be because of the inputs, not the arithmetic.
//
// The one deliberate difference: the server blends ERA5 reanalysis for hours that
// have already elapsed with forecast for the rest, and this uses the forecast for
// the whole day. Reanalysis is closer to what the weather actually did, so the
// server's figure for a past hour is the better one — but it costs a second HTTP
// request, and on a device whose screen shows one day at a time it is not worth
// it. Expect small disagreements on an unsettled afternoon.
//
// Lives outside src/device/ so the simulator's selftest compiles it: this is the
// part that is arithmetic rather than sockets, and arithmetic is what is worth
// testing.
